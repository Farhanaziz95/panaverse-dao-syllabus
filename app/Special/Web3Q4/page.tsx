                                In this course you will learn how to develop Web 3.0 DApps, create a project, deploy it in production, write smart contracts, unit test them, and create user interfaces for them. We will also learn to develop ERC-20 and NFT tokens, DAOs, Oracles, etc.  Please note that in order to develop Web 3 applications you also need to build on top of Web 2.0 technologies which we have already covered in the previous quarters.
